As we mentioned previously on the profiling section, the most resource intensive part
of the code was the attraction\_force() function. By changing this function to attraction\_force\_symm()
we will attempt to achieve better results, even though the initial profiling time was discouraging. 
We will now proceed to test the new function with different number of threads to see how the
performance is affected. This will constitute the last and final version of the SG-t-SNE-Pi algorithm:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The pure Julia implementation of the SG-t-SNE-Pi algorithm after the modifications.
\end{itemize}

We create a new julia file called bhembed.jl (Barnes Hut embed) which will be the same as embed.jl 
with the only difference that this one will use the parallelized method of calculating the attractions forces.
