We will now proceed to test the embed function which uses attraction\_force\_symm!() with different 
number of threads to see how the performance is affected. This version of the SG-t-SNE-Pi algorithm is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The pure Julia implementation of the SG-t-SNE-Pi algorithm after the modifications.
\end{itemize}

To implement this change we create a new julia file called bhembed.jl (Barnes Hut embed) which will
be the same as embed.jl with the only difference being that this one will use the parallelized method of 
calculating the attraction forces.
