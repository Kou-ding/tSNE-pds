This project aims to port the C/C++ implementation of SG-tSNE-Pi in the Julia programming language hoping 
to achieve even faster performance. The port has already been partially successful. The code seems to be 
functional but lacks in speed. Thus, in the next segments we will have to go through various utilities to 
map the program's functions and hopefully modify it to get closer to the original implementation's performance.

In order to optimize the code we need to figure out which parts of the code are the most time consuming.
To do this we will use the VsCode profiler which will give us a detailed report consisting of code loops
and their respective time consumption. The parts that take the most time are the ones that we can benefit 
more from optimizing them.

Lastly we will benchmark the code so that we can have a staring point to compare the optimized code with.
