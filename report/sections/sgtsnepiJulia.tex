This project aims to port the C/C++ implementation of sgtsnepi in the Julia programming language hoping 
to achieve even faster performance. The port has already been partially successful. The code seems to be 
functional but lacks in speed. Thus, in the next segmnets we will have to go through various utilities to 
map the program's functions and hopefully modify it to get closer to the  

In order to optimize the code we need to
